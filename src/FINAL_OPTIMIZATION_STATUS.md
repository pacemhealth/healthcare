- **Current Position:** After Why Choose Pacem (line ~1192-1417)
- **Target Position:** BEFORE Why Choose Pacem (insert before line ~1112)
- **Rationale:** Training differentiator should appear before summary section

- **Rationale:** Policy work targets governments (different audience), should separate from manufacturer services
